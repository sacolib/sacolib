    "text": "Projects:\nOur first project will be a guidebook of photographic or acoustic identification keys of similar looking or similar sounding organisms (with a focus on organisms within India at this point of time), hosted at iNaturalist.\nThere are many reasons for this project:\n\nThis will allow better validation of species identification, which in turn is used as training data by iNaturalist for their Computer Vision model. Seeing the uptick in the number of ID spammers who simply agree to an identification just to increase their identification counts without any verification of species identification, we are likely to enter an era of bad identification suggestions from the automated species identification tool of iNaturalisr which bases itself on the Computer Vision model, which in turn will be ‘Research Graded’ again by ID spammers, creating a vicious loop of trash in = trash out in machine learning model.\nSince a lot of Research Grade data from iNaturalist are being used for modelling species distributions and other trends, usually via GBIF, such validation will result in better quality data for research.\nIdentification keys available in literature are very hard for lay people and even biologists who don’t have expertise in the taxa to understand, due to the many taxonomic jargon and lack of clarity on what these terms mean. Many of them contribute to ‘citizen science’ initiatives like iNaturalist, but have to resort to the automated identification tool for the IDs or make “ID please” requests in groups dedicated to different taxa. Photographic or acoustic identification keys are key to empowering non-experts in identification.\nID keys like this hopefully result in lesser number of collections of animals like moths, who are usually dissected for identifications."

    "text": "SACoLib - Science Advocacy Collective for Liberation - is an anarchist collective of scientists from various fields around the world, working towards the collective liberation of animals (including humans). “Liberation” means liberating one from regressive exploitative worldviews and making the world better without being under the delusion that the capitalistic systems will enable that.\nLiberation includes animal liberation - liberation of animals exploited for irrational reasons that needs to evolve such as taste, traditions, culture, religion, convenience, and habit. It includes opening up information from niche scientific fields to everyone and helping people gain access to information that has been produced and reviewed by the free labour of millions of scientists and stolen and restricted by corporate publishers (and breaking free from such an inherently unethical system). Remember: if it is not available for scrutiny or replication or falsification, it is not science. It includes liberation of the environment from human greed; and much more.\nWe currently have two themes under which we will be launching projects:\n\nAnimal Liberation\nInformation Liberation\n\nVisit individual theme pages to know more.\nVisit this website occasionally for updates on our projects."
