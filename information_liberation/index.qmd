Aims:

-   To free up information that will help in advancing science.

-   To help reduce the suffering of animals (including humans) through the information liberated.

-   To make the data from existing “citizen science” and other databases available to the public in easy-to-understand formats and to help improve public understanding of science.

Our first project is the [**ID keys to wildlife in India**](id_keys/index.qmd)
